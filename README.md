# User Registration and Login System
This project is a simple user authentication system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a registration form, a login page, and a profile page that users can access after logging in. User credentials are securely stored in the browser's LocalStorage, allowing for client-side authentication without the need for a backend server.

## Features
1. User Registration: New users can create an account by filling out the registration form.
2. Login Page: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
3. Profile Page: Upon successful login, users are redirected to a profile page where they can view their account details.
4. LocalStorage Integration: User credentials (username and password) are stored in LocalStorage for authentication purposes.

## Usage
### Registration:

### Login:
